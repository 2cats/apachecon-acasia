We will delve into how Apache StreamPark, a one-stop real-time compute job management platform, optimizes production environment management for 300+ Flink ON K8S real-time compute jobs. Our practice focuses on optimizing a range of key management functions through a simple, intuitive visual interface. These include project management, job management, team management, rights management, alarm management, log management, version management, cluster management, resource configuration, Flink JAR, Flink SQL, and monitoring large screens. Further, we realized the dynamic optimization of the job, which effectively improved the operation efficiency; The archival collection and statistics of job anomalies greatly enhance the ability of troubleshooting; The offline scheduling data synchronization is realized in combination with the scheduling system, and the data processing flow is optimized. With Apache StreamPark, we implemented real-time job lifecycle management, which greatly simplified the operation and maintenance process, improved management efficiency, reduced failure rates, and improved the quality of business support. This process fully demonstrates the integration of real-time computing and the power of platform management, as well as its application value in the actual production environment.
